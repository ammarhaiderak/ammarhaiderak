# 👋 Hi, I'm Ammar

Engineer at heart. Systems thinker by default.

I design and build backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and distributed integrations that are meant to hold up — not just pass a demo.

## What I focus on

- Architecture-first backend engineering
- Production-ready cloud & DevOps systems
- Secure and resilient integrations (including EVM-based systems)
- Refactoring and stabilizing AI-generated or legacy codebases
- Designing systems that remain extensible as complexity grows

## How I work

I believe good software is designed — not assembled.

- Scale is considered from day one.
- Security is treated as a first-class concern.
- Tradeoffs are explicit.
- Documentation is part of engineering, not an afterthought.
- AI is used as a tool — supervised, reviewed, and aligned with engineering judgment.

## Tech I regularly work with

- Node.js (Express, NestJS)
- Python (FastAPI, Django)
- Kubernetes, Docker
- AWS, GCP, Azure
- Linux environments
- EVM smart contracts & secure backend integrations

## My approach to AI

AI-assisted development is powerful — when supervised.

I often work with codebases that:
- “Work 80%”
- Were generated by tools but lack structure
- Are difficult to maintain or extend

My work typically involves:
- Reducing unnecessary complexity
- Re-establishing architectural boundaries
- Making systems production-ready
- Restoring maintainability

## What I am currently learning ?

- How systems scale without collapsing under complexity

If you're building something that needs to scale, remain secure, and survive real-world complexity — let's talk.
